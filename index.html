I want to live forever
Inside the nights and days
Wish upon a silver cloud
Crawling across the moonbeams
A summer night in heaven
Between the stars and waves
Gaze across the old bonfire
Trample on my heartbeat
I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song
Wanted to be near you, but
Somebody owns you now
I love you with a fire
Ablaze until times end
But what good is a heart when it shudders to speak?
I guess it's too late now
I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song
Wanted to be near you but
Somebody owns you now
I'll try to live somehow
Somebody owns you now
I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song
Wanted to be near you but
Of course, somebody owns you now
And I'll try to live somehow
Somebody owns you now
Somebody owns you nowI want to live forever

And I'll try to live somehow
Somebody owns you now
Somebody owns you nowI want to live forever
Inside the nights and days
Wish upon a silver cloud
Crawling across the moonbeams
A summer night in heaven
Between the stars and waves
Gaze across the old bonfire
Trample on my heartbeat
I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song
Wanted to be near you, but
Somebody owns you now
I love you with a fire
Ablaze until times end
But what good is a heart when it shudders to speak?
I guess it's too late now
I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song
Wanted to be near you but
Somebody owns you now
I'll try to live somehow
Somebody owns you now
I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song
Wanted to be near you but
Of course, somebody owns you now
And I'll try to live somehow
Somebody owns you now
Somebody owns you nowI want to live forever
